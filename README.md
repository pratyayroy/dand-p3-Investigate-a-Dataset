Investigate a Dataset 
==========================

This repo contains files for my "P3 | Investigate a Dataset", done as a part of Data Analyst Nanodegree in Udacity.



Documents
---------

*  **Titanic.ipynb**: This is the Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed report for my Intro into Data Analysis project.
* **Titanic.html**: The html export of my notebook for those who don't have Jupyter installed. A simple browser is enough to view the report.
* **Titanic-data.csv**: The csv file downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) containing the training dataset.
*  **Udacity_Reviews.pdf**: This is Udacity Review for this project report.

> **Notes**
>
> Udacity's project did not require the prediction of the test dataset as in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). But, I do want to build a model to estimate the survival of the passengers in the test dataset. Please keep visiting this repo for an update.
